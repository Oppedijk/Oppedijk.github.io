<p>Some info on the new Zeus Touch and the GoFree Wireless Wifi-1 module</p>
<p>The Zeus 7 and 8 inch do have NMEA 0183, it's not mentioned in the specs, but the video cable (sold seperately) also has NMEA connectivity.</p>
<p>The Wifi-1 unit is connected with a special ethernet cable to the Zeus. The Wifi-1 unit has 2 ethernet ports.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Installation is very easy, connect the ethernet wire between the Zeus Touch and the GoFree Wifi 1, connect both to the power and you are ready to go.</p>
<p>We connected an H2000 system to the Zeus Touch through the video/nmea cable. The nice thing about the Zeus is that we can enable/disable every NMEA 0183 sentence we want (incoming and outgoing). We connected to the H2000 Performance processor NMEA port, the other option is to use the NMEA FFD.</p>
<p>The Zeus touch received an IP address of 192.168.0.1</p>
<p>The Wifi-1 unit received an IP address of 192.168.0.10, port number 10110 for NMEA0183 clients</p>
<h2>Depth sounder</h2>
<p>The Zeus Touch 7 and 8 inch modles have a build-in Depth unit. I need more info on this</p>
