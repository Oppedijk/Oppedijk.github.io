Instead of upgrading my Orchard instances, I decided to move to Jekyll hosted on github pages.

A cleanup of old content was done as well

Some lessons learned:

* Jekyll Collections only work when a page is linked to the URL, otherwise no content is generated.
* UTF-8 encoding without BOM is needed
* Windows Subsystem for Linux works like a charm for local development
