The official B & G bearings for the wind angle and wind speed are quite expensive. Why not buy some 3rd party bearings for 10% of the original price.

Type: SFR2-5ZZ

These should match the 213 and 496 Masthead units for Brookes and Gatehouse.

B&G part numbers 213-10-004 and 213-10-038 (just google the part number SFR2-5ZZ for a local shop, or use amazon.com or for the Netherlands https://Neita.nl).

Replacement is quite easy, remove the MHU from the mast, and there is one screw (secured behind a sticker) to remove to seperate the top and bottom parts. just replace the bearings and your windspeed sensor should work fine for a few more years.

For the 213 MHU, take a look at the picture above, the screws to open the unit are marked by the red arrows.
This is a <a href="/Media/Default/BandG/MHU/213_MHU_Parts_breakdown.pdf">pdf</a> with all the different parts and their numbers.

For the 496 unit, check out the pictures below (Thanks to JanW).
